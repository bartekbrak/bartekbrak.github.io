<pre><code>Dear Unhaggle.

I'd like to apply for the position of Python Developer you advertised.

I have over 5 years of experience building Python systems, most of them were web-based. I occasionally completed front end tasks and most of the systems I worked with used jQuery, I also use it in my personal projects. I have broad experience in Django and Python spanning several projects, including ones up to 100KLOC. I have used PostgreSQL and MySQL extensively and I am currently reading database books to put my level of understanding databases to a meta level. I've been using Linux for 15 years, I consider myself an expert. I know git very well, have introduced it in companies and helped design improved workflows, I have taught git. I focus on good practices, code readability and maintenance, to that end I have participated in code review cycle for years, I code in TDD style where I can. I do not have much Selenium hands-on practice but I'm familiar with the tool and wrote several test years ago, I would need to brush up on this tool.

I'm available to start in about 1.5 months.

Best regards
Bartek Rychlicki
