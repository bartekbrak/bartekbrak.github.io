# About Bartek Brak

Linguist turned programmer, from Welsh through Esperanto to Python, I am interested in all languages, human or programming. Now studying Natural Language Processing, used to deliver large-scale translation mechanisms in the retail industry. A humble student of best programming practices in elusive pursuit of reaching happiness through the Zen of Python. In my free time, I polish my teaching skills by sharing knowledge of Python ecosystem and Unix toolchain.

I worked for half of the interesting Python houses in Warsaw, Poland and try to build a broad understanding of how the IT industry works here and abroad. I believe the choice of technology is less important than company culture or recruitment strategy. I design and program, web applications, tools, data miners, integration glue, small, large, legacy and new. I go broad rather than deep. I used to teach English (TEFL, Celta) and like to share, mentor and build. I run a small programming community.
