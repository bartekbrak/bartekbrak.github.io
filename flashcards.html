<p>What is REST?
    :wikipedia
    one way of providing interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. REST-compliant web services allow requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of web resources using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations - usually HTTP verbs</p>
<p>What does REST stand for?
    Representational state transfer</p>
<p>Name two other forms of web service exist, beyond REST?
    :rest 
    WSDL, SOAP</p>
<p>What is a quine?
    :wikipedia
    A quine is a non-empty computer program which takes no input and produces a copy of its own source code as its only output.</p>
<p>Threads are expensive, and operating systems enforce a variety of hard caps on the number of threads a process, user, or machine may have. Give a ball park size of a thread
    50K</p>
<p>If we scale up to tens of thousands of simultaneous operations on concurrent sockets, which will run out first?
    threads, asyncio is the solution</p>
<p>C10K?
    Ten thousand connections, term coined by Kegel in 1999.</p>
<p>Create a nonblocking socket:
    sock = socket.socket()
    sock.setblocking(False)</p>
<p>Why does non blocking socket raise BlockingIOError on connect?
    A non-blocking socket throws an exception from connect, even when it is working normally. This exception replicates the irritating behavior of the underlying C function, which sets errno to EINPROGRESS to tell you it has begun.</p>
<p>What are two main features of async framework?
    non-blocking sockets and the event loop - to run concurrent operations on a single thread.</p>
<p>What's stack ripping?
    In async, it's the loss of context in a stack trace. The stack trace shows only that the event loop was running a callback. We do not remember what led to the error. The chain is broken on both ends: we forgot where we were going and whence we came. Stack ripping also prevents us from installing an exception handler for a chain of callbacks, the way a "try / except" block wraps a function call and its tree of descendents</p>
<p>What's a coroutine?
    it is a subroutine that can be paused and resumed. </p>
<p>What's the rough size of a coroutine?
    3K   </p>
