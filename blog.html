<h2>Toptal. Why am I trying to join and a few things you can do now whether you're joining or not.</h2>
<p>2016-11-22</p>
<p>I decided to quit my current job, take a break to learn few things, finish few things
and prepare to find a remote job. I spoke to my mentor and all programming friends
with experience in remote work trying to find a best way to get one. <a href="https://www.toptal.com/web">Toptal</a>
was mentioned more than once so I had a look. </p>
<p>I first thought <a href="https://www.toptal.com/web">Toptal</a> was a CV and offers aggregator. It turns out it's not and I 
needed to prepare myself better than just compiling a refreshed CV. It seems
they are trying to source the best developers from the market which is something 
I aspire to every now and then. They have a verification process in place that 
I was only partly ready for. One can never be ready when looking for a 
challenge, right? Challenge accepted.</p>
<p>Looking for a new employer myself is not so much fun, mainly because it takes a
lot of time. I enjoy the preparation part, cleaning up my demo projects, 
trimming my CV of irrelevant descriptions, reading the books from my "to read" 
list. What I don't enjoy is taking actual looking, I always fret that I just
won't come across the most interesting offers. I specialize in programming, not 
in HR aggregation after all. And here comes <a href="https://www.toptal.com/web">Toptal</a>. I hope they will save me 
time so I can focus on learning, not looking for work so much. </p>
<p>Here's an advice to those of you who are not currently looking for work. Soon
enough you will be. </p>
<p>Take time now to prepare for this. There are number of things you need to have 
in order to best present yourself in front of someone who'll be interested. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><em>Refresh your CV and keep it updated</em> with description of challenges as they come
along. When you finish your working at your current position, it's going to be 
harder to compile accurate description of all the interesting problems you're
solving now. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Get some sample code in order</em>. You will be asked to produce proof of your work, 
whether at <a href="https://www.toptal.com/web">Toptal</a> or elsewhere. The problem is, we usually write code for the 
employers, paid and under license, something we can't show. And even if we could, 
we rarely have a piece long enough that we wrote ourselves. Code is created in 
teams. 
You need to start a demo project. It might be hard to come up with an idea 
which is complex enough to show your true skills. Don't leave it until you need one. 
I had few projects lying around, but most were too simple and those that were not
required polishing. And boy does it take long to clean up and document a project
that just works. Don't wait, you'll never have time to do it, make time. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Write a copy about yourself</em>. Several of them, one short (79 characters ;) ), 
one longer and one longish. You might need it for various places, a sub-header
for you CV, linkedin profile. Writing a short description about yourself will 
force you to define it and it just isn't easy, we need to choose what to say, in
what form and what to stress. It took me more than an hour, on several occasions. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Start these now and you'll be able to improve them later on, hopefully arriving at
something that you accept. I started long ago.</p>
<p>Now, I'll report back on how useful <a href="https://www.toptal.com/web">Toptal</a> was in a while.  </p>

        # Time tracking for the paranoid. 

        Bartek

        github.com/bartekbrak

        I can Python, I like data, too much---

## Context

* Some companies have their own product, some work for multiple clients.
* Then some of us have to track time spent on a given task, specific project
 or client because... budgets. Lucky you who don't! It gets annoying.
* Multiple solutions are already there: toggl, harvest, RescueTime, 
  hamster, internal ones...
* And I hate them all 
  * they rarely do what I want, 
  * often impossible to extend, 
  * have a terminal client (and bash_completions)
  * work off-line

---

## What do I want?

* If I'm spending time on paperwork, I want to have full 
  control, ability to process that data... and go PARANOID:

  * visualize my work patterns
  * do useful stats - focus factor
  * tell me how much I've worked &quot;right now&quot; when my working hours are 
    irregular and when is *enough*
  * answer questions like
    * What is my typical productivity?
    * How does it change when working remotely?
    * What are my break patterns?
    * Is the task nearing its time budget?

* Accept the inconvenience


---

## Should I, should anyone? 

* Probably not, you might be focusing on the wrong problem... 

* Some people might take it the wrong way :|

* Maybe just change the job if they make you do stupid things?

* Meh... You want to know!

---

## Here's my app

* Alpha, POC, dirty, bad but working code, really bad frontend but 
  who cares

* Not ready for use unless you try hard

* Keep it minimal, throw away and rewrite when idea matures.

* Django, only four models

* No tests, you mad?!
---

## Conclusion

* typically 63% focus factor - 5hours 2minutes 24 seconds :P

* Remotely +16%, that's ~6hours more of pure focused work per week (but I tried
  hard). That's what I wanted to know!

* Visualizing helped, funny to see how I wake up later and later as the week 
  progresses. ---

<h2>[pl] Pasztet</h2>
<ul>
<li>zagotuj [zieloną|czerwoną] soczewicę z solą i czterema liściami laurowymi, 
zielona to jakieś 30-40min, czerwona kwadrans, w zielonej możesz sysyf zbierać z 
powierzchni wody, jak chcesz mieć płynny pasztet to wlej dwa więcej wody do czerwonej, jak chcesz
mieć twardy to mniej, z zielonej to ja bym wodę odlał, wygląda źle.</li>
<li>na dużej patelni wlej dużo oleju, pół szklanki może, może całą i praż na tym jakieś
przyprawy, w dni parzyste wsypuję curry+ papryka wędzona słodka, czasami 
sproszkowany czosnek, czasami cos inneog to bez znaczenia, nie praż ziół, 
oregano się spali, prażenie to 3060 sekund w zależności od ognia</li>
<li>na ten olej z przyprawami wrzuć poszatkowane warzywa korzenne, nie ważne jakie,
takie jakie masz, podstawą jest marchewka i cebula, inne to seler korzenny, pasternak,
pietruszka, por, możesz też prażyć wszystko inne, pieczarki, papryki, brokuł ale niech 
ci się nie wydaje, że będzie lepsze bo masz droższe warzywa. do tego prażenia też dodaj
liście laurowe cztery, czemu nie. Dodaj inne przyprawy według fantazji, to bez znaczenia,
ja czasami wrzucam gałkę muszkatałową, angielskie ziele, imbir (psuje), czili, 
no cokolwiek, to nie jest przepis, nie staramy się osiągnąć żadnego celu.</li>
<li>jak te warzywa będą miękkie to weź ich trochę i dodaj fo soczewicy i miksuj na 
papę, potem dodaj resztę, to się robi po to, żeby nie było nudno, gładki pasztet \
jest nudny, więc niektóre warzywa zostawiamy w całości</li>
<li>do pierkarnika i piecz aż będzie dobre w jakiejś wysokiej temperaturze, ja ostatnio robiłem
jakąś godzinę na 220, bez znaczenia, pasztet jest dobry nawet bez upieczenia</li>
