<h1>High Performance MySQL - Baron Schwartz, Peter Zaitsev, and Vadim Tkachenko. 3rd edition.</h1>
<p>MySQL accepts X.509 in auth, which is governed by hierarchical CAs, much different to PGP's web of trust.</p>
<p>Query cache can store only SELECT statements, along with their result sets. ... the server doesn’t need to parse, optimize, or execute the query at all, it can simply pass back the stored result set. (:fa-question: How does invalidation work?)</p>
<p><code>shared locks</code> and <code>exclusive locks</code>, or <code>read locks</code> and <code>write locks</code>. Read locks on a resource are shared, or mutually nonblocking: many clients can read from a resource at the same time. Write locks, on the other hand, are exclusive—i.e., they block both read locks and other write locks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Percona XtraDB is a storage engine for the MariaDB and Percona Server databases, and is intended as a drop-in replacement to InnoDB, which is one of the default engines available on the MySQL database.
XtraDB incorporates InnoDB's ACID-compliant design and MVCC architecture, and allows for a greater degree of tuning and scalability. The engine is also better suited to multi-core processing, which addresses some of the issues known to InnoDB</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Transactions aren’t enough unless the system passes the ACID test. ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.</p>
<p>Reading uncommitted data is also known as a <code>dirty read</code>.</p>
<p><code>phantom read</code> can happen when you select some range of rows, another transaction inserts a new row into the range, and then you select the same range again;</p>
<p>The way InnoDB currently handles deadlocks is to roll back the transaction that has the fewest exclusive row locks (an approximate metric for which will be the easiest to roll back).</p>
<p><code>multiversion concurrency control (MVCC)</code>, there is no standard for how MVCC should work. You can think of MVCC as a twist on row-level locking; it avoids the need for locking at all in many cases and can have much lower overhead. Depending on how it is implemented, it can allow nonlocking reads, while locking only the necessary rows during write operations.</p>
<p>In <code>InnoDB</code>, primary key column is part of secondary indexes so they grow large if primary is large - <code>clustered index</code>.</p>
<p><code>InnoDB</code>, unlike other storage engines, supports hot <code>backup</code> - Oracle’s proprietary MySQL Enterprise Backup and the open source Percona XtraBackup. MySQL’s other storage engines can’t take hot backups—to get a consistent backup, you have to halt all writes to the table, which in a mixed read/write workload usually ends up halting reads too.</p>
<p><code>ballpark figure</code>, guesstimate, an educated guess or estimation within acceptable bounds.</p>
<p>MySQL supports manual and automatic checking and <code>repairing of MyISAM tables</code>, but don’t confuse this with transactions or crash recovery. After repairing a table, you’ll likely find that some data is simply gone.</p>
<p><code>FederatedX</code>, sotrage engine that allows connecting to other systems rather than stroing data. </p>
<p><code>TokuDB</code> uses a new index data structure called Fractal Trees, which are cache-oblivious, so they don’t slow down as they get larger than memory, nor do they age or fragment.</p>
<p><code>RethinkDB</code>, ~~Falcon~~, <code>The NDB Cluster engine</code>, <code>The Merge storage engine</code>, <code>The Memory engine</code>, <code>The CSV engine</code>, <code>The Blackhole engine</code>, <code>Infobright</code> (column storage).</p>

<li>The full name is <code>the asymptotic analysis of worst-case complexity.</code></li>
</ul>
<p>RAM model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each simple operation (+, *, –, =, if, call) takes exactly one time step.</li>
<li>Loops and subroutines are not considered simple operations. Instead, they
are the composition of many single-step operations. It makes no sense for
sort to be a single-step operation, since sorting 1,000,000 items will certainly
take much longer than sorting 10 items. The time it takes to run through a
loop or execute a subprogram depends upon the number of loop iterations or
the specific nature of the subprogram.</li>
<li>
<p>Each memory access takes exactly one time step. Further, we have as much
memory as we need. The RAM model takes no notice of whether an item is
in cache or on the disk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Big Oh notation ignores the difference between multiplicative constants.
The functions <code>f(n) = 2n</code> and <code>g(n) = n</code> are identical in Big Oh analysis</p>

<p>Function names:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logarithmic: f(n) = log n</li>
<li>Linear: f(n) = n</li>
<li><code>Superlinear</code>: f(n) = n lg n</li>
<li>Quadratic: f(n) = n²</li>
<li>Cubic: f(n) = n³</li>
<li>Exponential: f(n) = cⁿ</li>
<li><code>Factorial</code>: f(n) = n!</li>
</ul>
<p>... is of greater order than ...</p>
<p>n! ≫ 2ⁿ ≫ n³ ≫ n² ≫ n log n ≫ n ≫ log n ≫ 1</p>
<p>O(f(n)) + O(g(n)) → O(max(f(n), g(n))) - sum of two functions is governed by the dominant one</p>
<p>:fa-exclamation-triangle: f(n) = O(n²), g(n) = O(n²), f(n) + g(n) = O(n²), not very intuitive</p>
<p>Logarithms arise in any process where things are repeatedly halved.</p>
<p>How many bits do we need to store 256 values? 8!</p>

<p>binary logarithm, natural log, common logarithm (base 10)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is log base ignored in Big Oh?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The base of the logarithm has no real impact on the growth rate- Compare
the following three values: log 2 (1, 000, 000) = 19.9316, log 3 (1, 000, 000) =
12.5754, and log 100 (1, 000, 000) = 3. A big change in the base of the logarithm
produces little difference in the value of the log. Changing the base of the
log from a to c involves dividing by log c a. This conversion factor is lost to
the Big Oh notation whenever a and c are constants. Thus we are usually
justified in ignoring the base of the logarithm when analyzing algorithms.</p>

<p>Take-Home Lesson: Reasonable-looking algorithms can easily be incorrect. Al-
gorithm correctness is a property that must be carefully demonstrated.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Take-Home Lesson: The heart of any algorithm is an idea. If your idea is
not clearly revealed when you express an algorithm, then you are using too
low-level a notation to describe it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The best way to prove that an algorithm is incorrect is to produce an instance in
which it yields an incorrect answer. Such instances are called counter-examples.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>greedy algorithm</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go for a tie – A devious way to break a greedy heuristic is to provide instances
where everything is the same size. Suddenly the heuristic has nothing to base
its decision on, and perhaps has the freedom to return something suboptimal
as the answer.</p>

<li>
<p>Σ, the summation operator</p>
</li>
<li>The summation of an infinite sequence of values is called a series.</li>
<li>
<p>The reason both seemed like magic is because recursion is mathematical induc-
tion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take-Home Lesson: Mathematical induction is usually the right way to verify
the correctness of a recursive or incremental insertion algorithm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The correctness of this algorithm is certainly not obvious to me. But as
it is recursive and I am a computer scientist, my natural instinct is to try to prove
it by induction.</p>
